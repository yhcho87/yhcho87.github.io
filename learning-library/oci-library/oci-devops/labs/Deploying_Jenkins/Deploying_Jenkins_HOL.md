## Overview

Faster software development has become a competitive advantage for companies. The automation of software development processes facilitates speed and consistency, which led to the rise for having a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CD) pipelines. Jenkins is a very popular product among Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers, which can automate all of the phases of CI and CD. You can host Jenkins on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to centralize your build automation and scale your deployment as the needs of your software projects grow.

## Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)  

## Practice-1: Sign in to OCI Console and create VCN


**Note:** OCI UI is being updated thus some screenshots in the instructions might be different than actual UI

**Before You Begin**

- We recommend using Chrome or Edge as the broswer. Also set your browser zoom to 80%

1. Sign in using your tenant name, user name and password.

2. From the OCI Services menu,click **Virtual Cloud Network** under Networking and click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**

**NOTE:** Ensure the correct Compartment is selected under COMPARTMENT list

3. Fill out the dialog box:

- **Create in Compartment:** Has the correct compartment

- **Name:** Enter easy to re¬member name

- **Create Virtual Cloud Network Plus Related Resources:** Select this option.

- Click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**

- Click **Close**

## Practice 2: Generate ssh keys, Create Compute instance, install OCI CLI and upload API keys

1. Click the Apps icon in the toolbar and select  Git-Bash to open a terminal window.

![]( img/RESERVEDIP_HOL006.PNG)

2. Enter command 
```
ssh-keygen
```
**HINT:** You can swap between OCI window, 
git-bash sessions and any other application (Notepad, etc.) by clicking the Switch Window icon 

![]( img/RESERVEDIP_HOL007.PNG)

3. Press Enter When asked for ‘Enter File in which to save the key’, ‘Created Directory, ‘Enter passphrase’, and ‘Enter Passphrase again.

![]( img/RESERVEDIP_HOL008.PNG)

4. You should now have the Public and Private keys:

/C/Users/ PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)

/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command 
```
cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
```
and then 
```
ls 
```
to verify the two files exist. 

5. In git-bash Enter command  
```
cat /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
 , highlight the key and copy 

![]( img/RESERVEDIP_HOL009.PNG)

6. Click the apps icon, launch notepad and paste the key in Notepad (as backup)

7. Switch to the OCI console. From OCI servies menu, Click **Instances** under **Compute** 

8. Click Create Instance. Fill out the dialog box:

- **Name:** Enter a name 

- **Availability Domain:** Select the first available domain.(usually AD1)

- **Image Operating System:** For the image, we recommend using the Latest Oracle Linux available.

10. Wait for Instance to be in **Running** state. In git-bash Enter Command:
```
 cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh
```
11. Enter 
```
ls
```
 and verify id_rsa file exists

12. Enter command 
```
ssh –i id_rsa opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE_INSTANCE>
```
**NOTE:** User name is opc

**HINT:** If ‘Permission denied error’ is seen, ensure you are using ‘-i’ in the ssh command

13. Enter ‘Yes’ when prompted for security message

![]( img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0014.PNG)
 
14. Verify opc@<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_NAME> appears on the prompt

15. To install OCI CLI on the compute instance, Enter Command:

```
bash -c "$(curl –L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-cli/master/scripts/install/install.sh)"
```

19. Check oci CLI installed version, Enter command:
```
oci -v
```
**NOTE:** Version shoudl be minimum 2.4.2X

![]( img/SGW_005.PNG)

20. Next we will configure OCI CLI. Enter command:

```
Press Enter when prompted for directory name to accept the default. You will be prompted to enter user OCID
![]( img/SGW_006.PNG)

21. Switch to OCI Console window, Click user icon (Top Right of OCI Console Window) and click **User Settings**. In User settings click **copy** next to OCID for your user name
![]( img/SGW_007.PNG)

22. Switch to git-bash window and paste the user OCID using 
mouse/touch pad and press Enter. You will be prompted to
Enter Tenancy OCID

23. Switch to OCI Console window, Click user icon (Top Right of OCI Console Window) and click your Tenancy name, copy the OCID as was done for user OCID. Also note down your region (in this example "us-ashburn-1")

RSA key pair’. Press Enter and accept default options for directories. Press Enter when prompted for passphrase (i.e leave it empty)
![]( img/SGW_010.PNG)

26.  In git-bash session for second compute, Enter command:
```
cd /home/opc/.oci
```
and then 
```
ls
```
Verify the API key files and OCI CLI config files exist.
![]( img/SGW_011.PNG)

27. Enter command 
```
cat config
```
and ensure fingerprint exists. Leave the git-bash session open as we will verify the
finger print in config file aginst OCI, once we upload api
keys next.
![]( img/SGW_012.PNG)

28. In git-bash window for second compute, Enter command 
```
cat /home/opc/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
```
, highlight the output, right click mouse/touchpad and click copy

30. Paste the content of oci_api_key_public.pem copied earlier and click **Add**.
![]( img/SGW_018.PNG)

31. A new finger print will be generated. Switch to git-bash window and enter command
```
cat /home/opc/.oci/config
```
Compare the finger print in the output of config file to 
the one in OCI console window and make sure they match

**NOTE:** If multiple finger prints exist in OCI console window then identify your finger print by looking at the time stamp.

## Practice-3: Install Jenkins, Configure Jenkins Master instance and create Jenkins Slave instance

1. Swtich to git bash widnow with ssh session to the compute instance

2. Enter below commands:
```
sudo yum install java –y
```
```
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins.repo
```        
```
sudo rpm --import https://jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key
```
```
sudo yum  install jenkins –y
```
```
sudo service jenkins start   
```
**(Ok message should be displayed)**
![]( img/Jenkins_003.PNG)

```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp  
```
**(By default,Jenkins listens on port TCP 8080. Open this port on the instance firewall by configuring the firewall)**
     
```
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
3.  To login to Jenkins master node we just set-up its password needs to be retrieved. Enter command ```
```
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword. 
```
Copy and paste the password to Notepad

![]( img/Jenkins_004.PNG)

4. Now we need to open port 8080 in Firewall rule for the compute instance. Switch to OCI console window. 

5. From OCI Services menu, click **Virtual Cloud Network** under Networking

6. Click on your VCN name, then Click **Default Security List for <VCN_NAME>**, and then **Edit All Rules**

8. Click **Save Security List Rules** (At the bottom of dialog box)

9. In OCI Console window, open a new browser tab 

![]( img/Jenkins_008.PNG)

10. Enter the URL 
http://<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE_INSTANCE>:8080
In the ‘Unlock Jenkins’ Screen, under ‘Administrator password’, copy/paste the password retrieved using command:

26. Verify ‘Started Provisioning’ message is displayed

![]( img/Jenkins_028.PNG)

27. Switch to OCI console window and Click **Instance** (if not already displayed). Verify new compute node (Jenkins-Slave) is being provisioned.
**HINT:** Ensure correct compartment is selected

![]( img/Jenkins_029.PNG)

28. Once compute instance is fully provisioned, switch back to Jenkins window and verify the new node appears on the screen. Click **Refresh Status** a few times to ensure Node is fully accessible (no next to it). You have now successfully deployed Jenkins with two compute nodes

![]( img/Jenkins_030.PNG)

***We have now successfully deployed Jenkins master and slave nodes on OCI.*** 

 ## Practice 4: Delete the resources
**NOTE:**  ***As a practice user will need to figure out any errors encountered during deletion of resources***

2. If your Compute instance is not displayed, From OCI services menu Click Instances under Compute

3. Locate first compute instance, Click Action icon and then **Terminat** 

![]( img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0016.PNG)

4. Make sure Permanently delete the attached Boot Volume is checked, Click **Terminate Instance**. Wait for instance to fully Terminate

![]( img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0017.PNG)

5. Repeat steps to delete other compute instance
